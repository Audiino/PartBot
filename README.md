# PartBot

_A morden rewrite of PartBot for Pokemon Showdown_

---

Hiya! This is an ongoing effort to rewrite [PartBot](https://github.com/PartMan7/PartBot) from the bottom-up, with better practices than the steaming pile of bamboo sticks that currently supports it.

This might take a while...

## Features

- Modular and extensible TypeScript codebase
- Real-time file watching and reloads
- Rich set of utilities for tournaments, games (e.g., Chess), and more

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+ recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (for persistence)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/PartMan7/PartBot.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   npm install
   ```

3. **Setup environment variables**
