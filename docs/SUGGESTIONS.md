# Suggestions, Bug Reports, and Feedback

Hi! If you're looking to contribute to PartBot (as a non-developer), you've come to the right place!

## Suggestions

Suggestions are tracked in the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/PartMan7/PartBotter/issues). New suggestions go in the [discussion thread](https://github.com/PartMan7/PartBotter/discussions/categories/ideas),
while accepted suggestions go into the thread as a feature. Feel free to make suggestions even if you're not sure how
implementable they are - I'll respond accordingly.

Some things to keep in mind while making a suggestion:

- Suggestions might not be implemented immediately even if approved; development on PartBot is somewhat-erratic and
  will happen whenever I find the availability.
  <br/><br/>
- Features that may be used to harass users will not be accepted.
  <br/><br/>
- PartBot is limited in terms of what it can and cannot do on PS - particularly on the UI front, it can only accept
  user input in one of three ways:
  <br/><br/>
  - The user types out and sends a message to PartBot.
  - The user clicks a button that is programmed to send a hardcoded message to PartBot.
  - The user submits an HTML form (eg: with textboxes) and the context of the form is forwarded as-is to PartBot.<br><br/>
    Because of this, user actions such as 'drag and drop' are not usable for inputs.
